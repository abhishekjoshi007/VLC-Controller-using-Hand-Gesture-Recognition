# VLC-Media-Player-Controller-using-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-System
We,Team Kryptonites, created a VLC Media Player Controller using Hand Gesture Recognition System to make ‘HUMAN LIFE EASY AND BETTER’.  
This project is implemented in two steps: 
(1.) Creation of Hand Gesture Recognition System: This is done using image processing using Opencv library. 
(2.) Controlling VLC Media Player using hand gestures: In this step we controlled the player using shell commands which were evoked using python commands through OS library.
