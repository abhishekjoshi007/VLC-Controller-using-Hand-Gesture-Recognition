# VLC-Media-Player-Controller-using-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-System
This project intends to facilitate the process of controlling(Pause, Play, Volume up, Volume Down, Mute) a video player by mere hand gestures without getting into the rigmarole of pressing buttons or tapping onto the screen. This can be assimilated into our day to life such as in presentations.
# This project is implemented in two steps: 
(1.) Creation of Hand Gesture Recognition System: This is done using image processing using Opencv library. 
(2.) Controlling VLC Media Player using hand gestures: In this step we controlled the player using shell commands which were evoked using python commands through OS library.
